This aim is to let you understand as much Zurich Swiss German as possible
with a contained set of examples. (We'll just say "Swiss German" from now on for simplicity, but Zurich Swiss German is only one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_German#Variation_and_distribution">many varieties</a>).

This assumes you understand High German at least as well as you hope to understand Swiss German. You can guess much of Swiss German based on High German. You might as well learn High German first, as it is the written and official language of all Swiss German speakers.

You should also have some way to listen to Swiss German. It's a spoken language, so this text-only format is lacking on its own
Hopefully it helps to have a foreigner try to describe the language from experience trying to learn it, but you also need to be around people speaking it and to be able to connect it to events in your real life.

This document will walk you through the motivation for all the flashcards, and you can find the set of all flashcards here (TODO).

In structuring this document, aims are

<ul>
<li> To explicitly focus only on differences from High German, avoiding the temptation to note similarities.
<li> To roughly order the categories of words in terms of how much additional Swiss German they allow a proficient High German speaker to understand.
<li> To prefer commonly-heard words (in particular, those that are less obvious from preceding examples).
<li> To have as small a set of example as possible to demonstrate common patterns and exceptions
</ul>

Spelling conventions: I won't try too hard to be consistent.
In many cases one can write "e" or "ä" for a sound which isn't really any of the English or High German "e", "ä", or "a". I'll usually just write "e".

<h2> Mapping High German to Swiss German</h2>

There are several very common patterns between corresponding words in High German and Swiss German.
Not all of these appear well in writing.

The first you might notice is that "n"s at the end of words in High German commonly disappear.

<ul>
<li> wone
<li> gester
<li> de Maa
<li> gägä
<li> scho
<li> vo
<li> oi
<li> ine
<li> (de?) Stei
</ul>

In some cases this isn't even consistently done, even within Zurich Swiss German,
particularly with some first-person verb conjugations:

<ul>
<li> Ich bi
<li> Ich bin
<li> Ich cha
<li> Ich chan
</ul>

The "ch" also often drops off

<ul>
<li> au
<li> no / na
<li> dur (dura?)
<li> Züri
<li> äntli
</ul>

(That last one means both "finally" and "small duck")

You will also notice a lot more "hard ch" sounds. Most times a "ch" or "k" appears
in a High German word, the corresponding Swiss German word has a hard "ch",
though it's usually still written as it is in High German.

<ul>
* kai
* koch
</ul>

If you *do* want a "k" sounds as in English, this becomes "gg"

<ul>
* brugg
</ul>

"st" often becomes "scht"

<ul>
* du bisch
* er isch
* du hasch
* de Stärn
</ul>

"sp" similarly often beomces "schp"

<ul>
* schpile
* de Gäscht
</ul>

"b" and "p" are closer together, as are "t" and "d", so often these change relative
to High German, when written. In general, these are <a href="https://eldrid.ch/advanced.htm">unaspirated</a>.

<ul>
* de Puure
* Dütsch
* Tütsch
* dörfe
* törfe
</ul>

Vowels often shift:

"i" often becomes "ie", with two vowels sounds (a dipthong)


<ul>
* d Liecht
</ul>

Many words already written with "ie" in High German are also pronounced this way

<ul>
* wie
* de Spiegel
</ul>

Sometimes "ie" becomes "üü", though!

<ul>
* tüüf
</ul>

"e" often becomes "ä" (which doesn't sound exactly like High German "ä")

<ul>
* wie gäht's?
* schlächt
</ul>

"i" can become "u"

<ul>
* d Brule
</ul>

"u" often becomes the two-syllable "uä" or "ue"

<ul>
* s Buäch
* guet
</ul>

"au" often becomes "uu" (or "üü")

<ul>
* s Muus
</ul>

"eu" often becomes "üü"

<ul>
* d Lüüt
* hüüt
</ul>

"ei" often becomes "ii"

<ul>
* sii
* d Ziit
* bi
</ul>

"o" can become "u"

<ul>
* d Wuche
* d Sunne
</ul>

The diminuitives "-lein" or "-chen" usually become "-li".

<ul>
* s Muusli
</ul>


The "-ung" ending often becomes "-ig". As in High German, "g" at the end of the word
sounds more like "k" in English.

<ul>
* d Quittig (?)
* d Rächnig
</ul>

Many common prepositions change in a predictable way

<ul>
* uf
* uus
* ai
* aa
</ul>

Those also apply when used as verb prefixes. Other prefixes are commonly shortened by dropping the vowel

<ul>
* zrugg
* bsuächt
* gmacht
</ul>

Often, letters drop off the end as well

<ul>
* grad
* jetz
</ul>

Place and language names also change in similar ways

<ul>
* Züri
* Stei am Rhii
* Züritüütsch
</ul>


</h2> Articles </h2>

Swiss German uses the same three genders as High German, and the nominative, accusative, and dative cases (never the genitive). The accusative form of words is the same as the nominative, outside of a few pronouns.

Unlike High German, Swiss German neuter articles and possessives sometimes feature an "s" on the end, like High German adjectives sometimes do.

The definite articles in the nominative and accusative look like shortened versions of the High German nominative ones:

<ul>
* de
* d
* s
* d
</ul>

The indefinite articles in the nominative differ more

<ul>
* en
* e
* es
* -
</ul>

As in High German, you add a "k" (but pronounced as a hard "ch") to the front to negate these.
but here the pronunciation also changes:

<ul>
* kain
* kai
* kais
* kai
</ul>

The definite articles in the dative also look like the High German ones, with either the first
or last letter chopped off

<ul>
* em
* de
* em
* de
</ul>

The indefinite, dative articles

<ul>
* emene
* enere
* emene
* -
</ul>

<h2> Pronouns </h2>

The only really surprising one here is "mir" meaning "we".

Nominative.

<ul>
* ich
* du
* er, si, (e)s
* mir
* ir
* si/Si
</ul>

Here, the accusative does look different, but is either the same as High German or the Swiss German dative form.

<ul>
* mich
* dich
* in/si/(e)s
* ois
* oi
* si/Si
</ul>

Dative

<ul>
* mir
* dir
* im/ire/im
* ois
* oi
* ine/Ine
</ul>

(See below that each of these also has an inverted form)

<h2> Possessive Pronouns </h2>

Nominative and accusative look the same here, so we can just give nominative and dative examples.
A regular pattern applies to form feminine, neuter, plural, and dative forms from the masculine nominative form,
so we don't have to give all 64 examples.

<ul>
* min Maa
* mini Frau
* mis Chind
* mini Chind

* mit mim Maa
* mit minere Frau
* mit mim Chind
* mit minere Chind

* din Maa

* sin Maa

* ire Maa
* iri Frau
* ires Chind
* iri Chind

* mit irem Maa
* mit irere Frau
* mit irem Chind
* mit irere Chind

* oise Maa
* oiji Maa

* Ire Maa
</ul>

<h2> Adjective endings </h2>

<h2> New Grammar and Constructions </h2>

Swiss German has a few points of grammar and constructinos that don't appear in High German.

<h3> Inversions and pro-drops </h3>


[Can use picture of pro-drop for du]

The inverted form of "du" can just be "du", but is often nothing, so Swiss German is "pro drop" in this sense

<ul>
* Hasch hunger?
* Hasch du hunger?
</ul>

In the accusative, with reflexive verbs, you have different inversions, including one for "dich"

<ul>
* Ich froimi seer
* (something iwth -di)
</ul>

<h3> go </h3>

When coming or going to do do something (a verb), add "go" before the verb.
This can look superficially like English sentences like "I'm going to go work", but this is more confusing than helpful.

<ul>
* Ich gang go schaffe : I'm going (somewhere) to work
* Ich chume go schlafe : I'm coming to sleep
</ul>

<h3> Relative pronouns </h3>

You use "wo" for all relative pronouns in Swiss German.

<ul>
* Ich bi de Maa, wo da wont
</ul>

<h3> Demonstrative Pronouns </h3>

<ul>
* dies (??)
</ul>

<h3> Tuä + verb </h3>


<h3> n-liasons </h3>

We noted that Swiss German tends to drop "n"s, compared to High German. This leaves a lot of vowels at the ends of words, so (like French), often an "n" will be introduced to make things flow better.

<ul>
* guete-n-aabig
* Min Name-n-isch
</ul>

<h2> Verbs </h2>

The standard conjugation only has four forms. All the plural forms are the same!

<ul>
* ich mache
* du machsch
* er macht
* mir mached
</ul>

Swiss German only uses the compound past tense, never the preterit. This includes with "sii" (to be).

<ul>
* Ich bin gsii
</ul>

Past participles are listed below for some verbs. Compared to High German,
many more lack the "g-" prefix, beyond those that start with unseparable prefixes.

* TODO examples from 9. in grammar book

"du" forms often end

<ul>
* Du haissisch
</ul>

TODO need quite a few conjugations of many of these to cover various common, irregular ones.

<ul>
* sii
* haa
* choo
* chume
* gaa
* wüsse
* gseh
* laa
* säge
</ul>

Modals:
<ul>
* törfe
* welle
* solle
* müäse
* möge
</ul>

More, some of which differ greatly from High German:
<ul>
* poschte
* luege
* löse
* schaffe
* laufe
* ränne
* rede
* schmöcke (for smell *and* taste!)
* aalüte (to call)
* pfuuse

* tschuute

* zügle (to move)

* chrampfe (work hard)

* ah ha [more common than "trage" for clothes]

* Sport triibe
* Hor uf!


* härcho vo : to come from
</ul>


There are some "fun" verbs

<ul>
* badele
* sünnele
* zmorgele
</ul>

</ul>

You usually use "am" not "um", but

<ul>
* um mitternacht
</ul>

Two of these are also used as the traditional morning and afternoon snacks
