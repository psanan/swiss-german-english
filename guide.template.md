This aim is to let you understand as much Zurich Swiss German as possible
with a contained set of examples. (We'll just say "Swiss German" from now on for simplicity, but Zurich Swiss German is only one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_German#Variation_and_distribution">many varieties</a>).

This assumes you understand High German at least as well as you hope to understand Swiss German. You can guess much of Swiss German based on High German. You might as well learn High German first, as it is the written and official language of all Swiss German speakers.

You should also have some way to listen to Swiss German. It's a spoken language, so this text-only format is lacking on its own
Hopefully it helps to have a foreigner try to describe the language from experience trying to learn it, but you also need to be around people speaking it and to be able to connect it to events in your real life.

This document will walk you through the motivation for all the flashcards, and you can find the set of all flashcards here (TODO).

In structuring this document, aims are

<ul>
<li> To explicitly focus only on differences from High German, avoiding the temptation to note similarities.
<li> To roughly order the categories of words in terms of how much additional Swiss German they allow a proficient High German speaker to understand.
<li> To prefer commonly-heard words (in particular, those that are less obvious from preceding examples).
<li> To have as small a set of example as possible to demonstrate common patterns and exceptions
</ul>

Spelling conventions: I won't try too hard to be consistent, but

<ul>
<li> In many cases one can write "e" or "ä" for a sound which isn't really any of the English or High German "e", "ä", or "a". I'll usually just write "e".
<li> In many cases one can write "u" or "ü". I'll prefer just "u".
</ul>


TODO: see Ch6 and rest of Swissing Grammar book for good examples.

<h2> Mapping High German to Swiss German</h2>

There are several very common patterns between corresponding words in High German and Swiss German.
Not all of these appear well in writing.

The first you might notice is that "n"s at the end of words in High German commonly disappear.

* wone
* gester
* de Maa
* gägä
* scho
* vo
* oi
* ine
* (de?) Stei

In some cases this isn't even consistently done, even within Zurich Swiss German,
particularly with some first-person verb conjugations:

* Ich bi
* Ich bin
* Ich cha
* Ich chan

The "ch" also often drops off

* au
* no
* dur (dura?)
* äntli

(That last one means both "finally" and "small duck")

You will also notice a lot more "hard ch" sounds. Most times a "ch" or "k" appears
in a High German word, the corresponding Swiss German word has a hard "ch",
though it's usually still written as it is in High German.

* kai
* koch

If you *do* want a "k" sounds as in English, this becomes "gg"

* brugg

"st" often becomes "scht"

* du bisch
* er isch
* du hasch
* de Stärn

"sp" similarly often beomces "schp"

* schpile
* de Gäscht

"b" and "p" are often fluid

* de Puure

Similarly, "t" and "d" are blurred and many words are often written either way.

* Dütsch
* Tütsch
* dörfe
* törfe

Vowels often shift:

"i" often becomes "ie", with two vowels sounds (a dipthong)

* d Liecht

In many words, "ie" is also pronounced this way

* wie
* de Spiegel

Sometimes "ie" becomes "üü", though!

* tüüf

"e" often becomes "ä" (which doesn't sound exactly like High German "ä")

* wie gäht's?
* schlächt

"i" can become "u"

* d Brule

Similarly, "u" often becomes the two-syllable "uä" or "ue"

* s Buäch
* guet

"au" often becomes "uu" (or "üü")

* s Muus

"eu" often becomes "üü"

* d Lüüt
* hüüt

"ei" often becomes "ii"

* sii
* d Ziit
* bi

"o" can become "u"

* d Wuche
* d Sunne

The diminuitives "-lein" or "-chen" usually become "-li".

* s Muusli


The "-ung" ending often becomes "-ig". As in High German, "g" at the end of the word
sounds more like "k" in English.

* d Quittig (?)
* d Rächnig

Many common prepositions change in a predictable way

* uf
* uus
* ai
* aa

Those also apply when used as verb prefixes. Other prefixes are commonly shortened by dropping the vowel

* zrugg
* bsuächt
* gmacht

Often, letters drop off the end as well

* grad
* jetz

Place and language names also change in similar ways

* Züri
* Stei am Rhii
* Züritüütsch


</h2> Articles </h2>

Swiss German uses the same three genders as High German, and the nominative, accusative, and dative cases (never the genitive). The accusative form of words is the same as the nominative, outside of a few pronouns.

Unlike High German, Swiss German neuter articles and possessives sometimes feature an "s" on the end, like High German adjectives sometimes do.

The definite articles in the nominative and accusative look like shortened versions of the High German nominative ones:

* de
* d
* s
* d

The indefinite articles in the nominative differ more

* en
* e
* es
* -

As in High German, you add a "k" (but pronounced as a hard "ch") to the front to negate these.
but here the pronunciation also changes:

* kain
* kai
* kais
* kai

The definite articles in the dative also look like the High German ones, with either the first
or last letter chopped off

* em
* de
* em
* de

The indefinite, dative articles

* emene
* enere
* emene
* -

<h2> Pronouns </h2>

The only really surprising one here is "mir" meaning "we".

Nominative.

* ich
* du
* er, si, (e)s
* mir
* ir
* si/Si

Here, the accusative does look different, but is either the same as High German or the Swiss German dative form.

* mich
* dich
* in/si/(e)s
* ois
* oi
* si/Si

Dative

* mir
* dir
* im/ire/im
* ois
* oi
* ine/Ine

(TODO maybe include reflexive prnouns as in 7. in the grammar book)

(See below that each of these also has an inverted form)

<h2> Possessive Pronouns </h2>

Nominative and accusative look the same here, so we can just give nominative and dative examples.
A regular pattern applies to form feminine, neuter, plural, and dative forms from the masculine nominative form,
so we don't have to give all 64 examples.

* min Maa
* mini Frau
* mis Chind
* mini Chind

* mit mim Maa
* mit minere Frau
* mit mim Chind
* mit minere Chind

* din Maa

* sin Maa

* ire Maa
* iri Frau
* ires Chind
* iri Chind

* mit irem Maa
* mit irere Frau
* mit irem Chind
* mit irere Chind

* oise Maa
* oiji Maa

* Ire Maa

<h2> Adjective endings </h2>

TODO learn in class!

<h2> New Grammar and Constructions </h2>

Swiss German has a few points of grammar and constructinos that don't appear in High German.

<h3> Inversions and pro-drops </h3>


[Can use picture of pro-drop for du]

The inverted form of "du" is nothing, so Swiss Germanis "pro drop" in this sense

* Hasch hunger?

In the accusative, with reflexive verbs, you have different inversions, including one for "dich"

* Ich froimi seer
* (something iwth -di)

<h3> go </h3>

When coming or going to do do something (a verb), add "go" before the verb.
This can look superficially like English sentences like "I'm going to go work", but this is more confusing than helpful.

* Ich gang go schaffe : I'm going (somewhere) to work
* Ich chume go schlafe : I'm coming to sleep

<h3> Relative pronouns </h3>

You use "wo" for all relative pronouns in Swiss German.

* Ich bi de Maa, wo da wont

<h3> Demonstrative Pronouns </h3>

* dies (??)

<h3> Tuä + verb </h3>


<h3> n-liasons </h3>

We noted that Swiss German tends to drop "n"s, compared to High German. This leaves a lot of vowels at the ends of words, so (like French), often an "n" will be introduced to make things flow better.

* guete-n-aabig
* Min Name-n-isch

<h2> Commonly-used verbs </h2>

The standard conjugation only has four forms. All the plural forms are the same!

* ich mache
* du machsch
* er macht
* mir mached

Swiss German only uses the compound past tense, never the preterit. This includes with "sii" (to be).

* Ich bin gsii

Past participles are listed below for some verbs. Compared to High German,
many more lack the "g-" prefix, beyond those that start with unseparable prefixes.

* TODO examples from 9. in grammar book

"du" forms often end

* Du haissisch

The basic verbs of motion, and modals:

* haa
* choo
* chume
* gaa

* törfe
* welle
* solle
* müäse
* möge

Some other very common ones

* wüsse
* gseh
* laa
* säge



Some very common verbs differ from High German:
* poschte
* luege
* löse
* schaffe
* laufe
* ränne
* rede
* schmöcke (for smell *and* taste!)

But also very common:

* Hor uf!

* pfuuse

* tschuute

There are some "fun" verbs

* badele
* zmorgele

## Numbers and Time

Numbers in Swiss German have different forms as nouns. These forms are used for times, ages, and even snack times!

* am foifi : at five o'clock

* viertel ab halbi nüüni

Two of these are also used as the traditional morning and afternoon snacks

* znüüni
* zvieri


## Everyday Phrases

Quite a few of these are from French:

* hoi
* hoi mitenand
* grüezi
* salut
* en guete
* schöne (Tag)
* märsi
* sorry
* ade

* hei
* dihei

* morn
* morge
* spöter

* dur / dura (??)

* welles (which ??)

* Ich schaffe z Züri

* Uf em Wält choo

## Vocabular

Swiss German uses the diminuitive "-li" extensively, and with some words almost exclusively. As in High German,
these words are always neuter.

* s Gipfeli
* es Bitzli
* Bussi

You will also often see abbreviations, especially for child-related things,
just ending in "-i".

* Kinski (?)
* Spilpi
* Kispi

* nüt

* nöd
* sust [can use picture]

* mer
* mängish
* nüme
* nönig

1. Abe, obe
1. Alli? Alles?


Some words have surprising plurals

* d Chind

Many variants of "something" or "someone" use variants of "öppis"

* öppis
* öpper
* öppen-n-am
* öppedia


Some common words are totally distinct from High German

* da (not "hier")
* de Bueb
* Poulet
* ume
* moll (also "doch", though)
* s Velo
* Töff
* bike
* Portmonnaie
* Cheminee
* zmorge
* zmittag
* znacht


* gruusig
* mega
* geil
* fain (not "lecker")

* Stube
* Beiz(li)

* Uusgang
