This aim is to let you understand as much Zurich Swiss German as possible
with a contained set of examples. (We'll just say "Swiss German" from now on for simplicity, but Zurich Swiss German is only one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_German#Variation_and_distribution">many varieties</a>).

This assumes you understand High German at least as well as you hope to understand Swiss German. You can guess much of Swiss German based on High German. You might as well learn High German first, as it is the written and official language of all Swiss German speakers.

You should also have some way to listen to Swiss German. It's a spoken language, so this text-only format is lacking on its own.

This document will walk you through the motivation for all the flashcards, and you can find the set of all flashcards here (TODO).

In structuring this document, aims are

<ul>
<li> To roughly order the categories of words in terms of how much additional Swiss German they allow a proficient High German speaker to understand.
<li> To prefer commonly-heard words (in particular, those that are less obvious from preceding examples).
<li> To have as small a set of example as possible to demonstrate common patterns and exceptions
</ul>

Spelling conventions: I won't try too hard to be consistent, but

<ul>
<li> In many cases one can write "e" or "ä" for a sound which isn't really any of the English or High German "e", "ä", or "a". I'll usually just write "e".
<li> In many cases one can write "u" or "ü". I'll prefer just "u".
</ul>


TODO: see Ch6 and rest of Swissing Grammar book for good examples.

<h2> Mapping High German to Swiss German</h2>

There are several very common patterns between corresponding words in High German and Swiss German.
Not all of these appear well in writing.

The first you might notice is that "n"s at the end of words in High German commonly disappear.

* wone
* gester
* scho

The "ch" also often drops off

* au
* no
* äntli

(That last one means both "finally" and "small duck")

You will also notice a lot more "hard ch" sounds. Most times a "ch" or "k" appears
in a High German word, the corresponding Swiss German word has a hard "ch",
though it's usually still written as it is in High German.

* kai
* koch

If you *do* want a "k" sounds as in English, this becomes "gg"

* brugg

"st" often becomes "scht"

* du bisch
* er isch
* du hasch
* de Stärn

"sp" similarly often beomces "schp"

* schpile
* de Gäscht

"b" and "p" are often fluid

* de Puure

Similarly, "t" and "d" are blurred and many words are often written either way.

* Dütsch
* Tütsch
* dörfe
* törfe

Vowels change in regular ways:

"i" often becomes "ie", with two vowels sounds (a dipthong)

* d Liecht

In many words, the similar-sounding "ie" is also pronounced as a dipthong

* wie
* de Spiegel

Sometimes "ie" becomes "üü", though!

* tüüf

Similarly, "u" often becomes the two-syllable "uä"

* s Buäch

"au" often becomes "uu" (or "üü")

* s Muus

"eu" often becomes "üü"

* d Lüüt

"ei" often becomes "ii"

* sii
* d Ziit

The diminuitives "-lein" or "-chen" usually become "-li".





The "-ung" ending often becomes "-ig". As in High German, "g" at the end of the word
sounds more like "k" in English.

* d Quittig (?)
* d Rächnig

Many common prepositions change in a predictable way

* uf
* uus
* ai
* aa

Those also apply when used as verb prefixes. Other prefixes are commonly shortened by dropping the vowel

* zrugg
* bsuächt
* gmacht



</h2> Articles, Pronouns, and Possessives. </h2>

Swiss German uses the same three genders as High German, and the nominative, accusative, and dative cases (never the genitive). The accusative form of words is the same as the nominative, outside of a few pronouns.

Unlike High German, Swiss German neuter articles and possessives sometimes feature an "s" on the end, like High German adjectives sometimes do.


</h2> Adjective endings </h2>

</h2> New Grammar and Constructions </h2>

Swiss German has a few points of grammar and constructinos that don't appear in High German.

</h3> Inversions and pro-drops </h3>



### go

When coming or going to do do something (a verb), add "go" before the verb.
This can look superficially like English sentences like "I'm going to go work", but this is more confusing than helpful.

* Ich gang go schaffe : I'm going (somewhere) to work
* Ich chume go schlafe : I'm coming to sleep

### n-liasons

We noted that Swiss German tends to drop "n"s, compared to High German. This leaves a lot of vowels at the ends of words, so (like French), often an "n" will be introduced to make things flow better.

* guete-n-aabig

## Commonly-used verbs

Swiss German only uses the compound past tense, never the preterit. This includes with "sii" (to be).

* Ich bin gsii

* poschte

* luege

* löse

* pfuuse

* haisse

## Numbers and Time

Numbers in Swiss German have different forms as nouns. These forms are used for times, ages, and even snack times!

* am foifi : at five o'clock

* viertel ab halbi nüüni


## Everyday Phrases

* hoi
* hoi mitenand
* grüezi
* salut
* en guete
* schöne (Tag)
* märsi
* sorry

* hei
* dihei

* dur / dura

* Ich schaffe z Züri

* Uf em Wält choo

## Vocabular

Swiss German uses the diminuitive "-li" extensively, and with some words almost exclusively. As in High German,
these words are always neuter.

* s Gipfeli

You will also often see abbreviations, especially for child-related things,
just ending in "-i".

* Kinski (?)
* Spilpi
* Kispi


Some common words are totally distinct from High German

* de Bueb
* Poulet
