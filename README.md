# Swiss German to English

Resources for a native English speaker, with some knowledge of High German,
to learn Swiss German.

1. A reference for valid Zurich Swiss German to English translations

2. A guide presenting a small subset of these to bring understanding of Swiss German closer to understanding of High German

## Scope and data

This is a curated set of examples to help someone (roughly like me) learn.
It's not a complete reference or dictionary.

The underlying data is a small set of translations of Swiss German strings to English (and optionally High German) ones.

Ambiguity should usually be resolved simply by using longer examples, e.g.
"mir" can mean both "we" and "to me", so include entries like "mir sind" and "mit mir".

A given Swiss German string should only appear in a single entry. Entries can have multiple strings
in each language.
Any of the English (or High German) strings must be a valid translation of any of the Swiss German strings.

We adopt the convention that anything in parentheses (plus a space if needbe)
can be removed and not affect validity of the translation. This is helpful
both to cover small variations in Swiss German spelling, e.g. "cho(o)", or for optional words
in English translations e.g. "to run (on foot)".

Strings should not be capitalized, except for
* Full sentences
* Swiss German and High German nouns and other words (e.g. "Si") always capitalized.

Data entries may also include free-form notes in English.
