to learn Swiss German.

2. A guide presenting a small subset of these to bring understanding of Swiss German closer to understanding of High German

## Scope and data

This is a curated set of examples to help someone (roughly like me) learn.
It's not a complete reference or dictionary.

Rather, it's aggressively example-based.  The underlying data is a small set of
translations of Swiss German strings to English and optionally High German
ones.

Interesting usage and differences from High German should be shown, not told.
Clarify by using longer examples, e.g.  since "mir" can mean both "we" and "to
me", include entries like "mir sind" and "mit mir".

A given Swiss German string should only appear in a single entry. Entries can
have multiple strings in each language.  Any of the English or High German
strings must be a valid translation of any of the Swiss German strings.

Strings should not be capitalized, except for
* Full sentences
* Swiss German and High German nouns and other words (e.g. "Si") always capitalized.

Parenthesized expressions should generally be avoided in the examples, preferring
examples which don't require them, or multiple valid translations. If included,
they should only be in High German or English strings, and the translation should
be valid with or without the parenthesized expression (plus a space if needbe).

Many Swiss German words have an optional letter at the end. If truly optional
(not an n-liason, and both forms are always interchangeable), these parenthesized
letters are also acceptable (e.g. "cha(n)").
