TODO for guide
<ul>
<li> Iterate until happy
  <ul>
    <li> Resolve last vocab TODOs in text
    <li> Fix N (500? 444? 333? Less even?) and cut down (make each entry count!). Make as short as possible! (prioritize the things furthest from High German, choose most powerful examples.)
    <li> The guide should be max 2N lines
    <li> Simplify translation by chooisng conventions (see below) and removing distracting duplicates (e.g. "e" vs "채" variants, etc.)
    <li> Fiddle with appearance ("p" tags not consistent, leads to bad spacing)
    <li> Attempt to recheck all entries (maybe add columns to tsv for source?) [especially possessives, pronouns, etc. which will certainly have errors]  (maybe try and get Swissing teacher to look, if I have a solo lesson..)
  </ul>
<li> Any stray TODOs anywhere in the repo
<li> Get feedback on GitHub version
<li> Move to final location at patricksanan.org (just include in github.io repo?)
<li> Think about chopping audio from the Swissing material and/or Luana mulirama podcasts! (wont' be complete, but audio clips are essential here..) (would be useful to go through that, anyhow)
</ul>

# Swiss German to English

Resources for a native English speaker, with knowledge of High German,
to learn Swiss German.

1. A reference for valid Zurich Swiss German to High German and English translations

2. A guide presenting a small subset of these to bring understanding of Swiss German closer to understanding of High German

If you (especially if you're a native Z체rich Swiss German speaker)
find a mistake in one of the guides, please open an issue or pull request for this repository.

## Scope and data conventions

The main data source is [translations.tsv](./translations.tsv), a small set of
translations of Swiss German strings to English and optionally High German
ones.

It's not a complete reference or dictionary, including only examples used in the
current guide(s) above and potential future ones.

Interesting usage and differences from High German should be shown, not told.
Clarify by using longer examples, e.g.  since "mir" can mean both "we" and "to
me", include entries like "mir sind" and "mit mir".

A given Swiss German string should only appear in a single entry. Entries can
have multiple strings in each language. Not tabs are allowed. Any of the English or High German
strings must be a valid translation of any of the Swiss German strings.  This
covers variations both in spelling (which should only be relevant for Swiss German),
interchangeable strings in the source language (e.g. "doch" and "moll" in Swiss
German), and multiple valid translations in the target languages.

Strings should not be capitalized, except for
* Full sentences (which should then end with punctuation)
* Words which are always capitalized

Parenthesized expressions should generally be avoided in the examples,
preferring examples which don't require them, or multiple valid translations.
If included, entries should be valid, up to whitespace, as if individual
strings with and without the parenthetical expressions were included.

This guide is not self-consistent with respect to Swiss German orthography.
In general, when choosing between equally-valid spelling options, prefer:

- shorter forms over longer ones
- "aa" over "ah" (gaats)
- "e" over "채" (wie)
- "o" over "oo" (cho)
- "oi" over "eu" (ois)
- "d" over "t" (D체tsch)
- "b" over "p" (Bire)
